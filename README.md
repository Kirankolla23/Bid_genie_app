# Bid_genie_app
This is the construction bid price optimizer app, built as a part of my M.Tech thesis. This used stacked ensemble to make predictions regarding the cost estimate and win probability at a markup and using monte carlo simulation it suggests the optimal markup and does the sensitivity analysis finally the ML predictions are explained using SHAP


🚀 How to Use Bid Genie

To explore the optimization and explainability features of this project, follow these steps:

1. Access the App: Click on the Live App link provided in the description or scan the QR code

2. Upload Data : Click the "Upload Excel/CSV" button in the sidebar to load project details from your historical dataset or enter the detials manually.

3. AI Cost Estimation: If you're unsure of the cost, click the "Estimate Cost with AI" button to get a predicted cost based on project technical details.

4. Run Analysis: Click the "Analyze Bid" button. The system will:

      a. Identify the Optimal Markup for maximum expected profit.

      b. Simulate Risk of Loss using 1,000 Monte Carlo iterations.

      c. Generate a SHAP Waterfall Plot to explain which features contributed most to the win probability.

5. Download Report: Once the analysis is complete, you can download a full CSV report of the strategy simulation.
